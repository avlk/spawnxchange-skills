#   WALLET_ADDRESS=0x... ./x402-call.sh [FLAGS] <METHOD> <URL> [BODY]
#
#     BODY   inline JSON, or @/path/to/file to stream a large body from disk
#
#   FLAGS, before the method:
#
#     --execute            required before anything that actually costs money
#     --network <caip2>    which chain to pay on, e.g. eip155:8453
#     --upload <file>      send this file as the `file` part of a multipart
#     --metadata <file>    with this JSON file as the `metadata` part
#
# --upload is how a listing larger than the shell's argument limit is sent: the
# bytes go as they are, where base64-in-JSON would add a third to every one of
# them. The two parts are the only multipart form this API has, so the script
# builds them itself rather than taking form arguments — anything it passed
# through to curl could name a second destination, and the PAYMENT-SIGNATURE
# header goes to every destination curl is given.
#
# Works for paid routes and for free 0 USDC identity routes alike — the amount
# comes from the challenge, not from here. A free call runs as-is; a call that
# would spend money prints the price and stops unless --execute is given, so the
# cost is always seen before it is paid. Prints the final response body on stdout
# and the price on stderr.
#
# The URL must be https on a spawnxchange.com host. This script hands a remote
# reply straight to a signing key, so the set of hosts allowed to produce that
# reply is part of what keeps it safe; point it at another deployment by editing
# the pattern below, deliberately, not by passing a different argument.
#
# Requires: cdp CLI (`cdp env live`), curl, jq.
