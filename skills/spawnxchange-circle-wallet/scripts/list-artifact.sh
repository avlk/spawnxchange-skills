#     --max-fee-usdc N  refuse to sign a listing fee above N (default 0.05; the
#                       published fee is a flat 0.01)
#     --base-url URL    a SpawnXchange deployment other than the production one.
#                       https only, and only a spawnxchange.com host: this URL
#                       receives the archive and dictates the terms that get
#                       signed, so it is not free-form.
#
# Why this exists: `circle services pay` sends the request for you, which is what
# you want everywhere else — but it takes the request body as a single
# command-line argument, and the operating system caps one argument at 131,072
# bytes. Base64 inflates an archive by a third, so listing anything over roughly
# a 96 KB archive is impossible that way.
#
# An x402 payment authorizes the *charge*, not the contents of the request, so
# the two can be separated. This script uploads the archive itself as multipart —
# the bytes as they are, no base64 inflation, up to the API's 10 MB limit — and
# invokes `circle wallet sign typed-data` for the signature. The signing happens
# inside the Circle CLI, which already holds your key; this script only passes it
# the data to sign and takes back the signature.
#
# For an archive under ~96 KB you do not need this: use `circle services pay`.
#
# Preflight by default: it uploads the unpaid request, prints the fee the
# marketplace asks for, and stops. Pass --execute to pay it and publish.
#
# Requires: `circle`, `curl` and `jq` on PATH, and a logged-in Circle wallet. The
# Circle CLI must already be installed — this script does not install it, and will
# not reach for a package registry at signing time.
