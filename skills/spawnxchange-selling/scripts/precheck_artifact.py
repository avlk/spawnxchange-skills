"""Look over an artifact folder before you package and publish it.

Standard library only. No network access, no credentials, nothing written and
nothing copied: this reads one folder and tells you what is in it that you may
not want to sell, while changing it is still cheap.

Anything that looks like a secret is reported as a file and a line number, never
as the value. Output like this ends up in transcripts and CI logs, and a checker
that quotes the key it found has moved that key somewhere it will be kept.

Check the folder, fix what it finds, check again, and only then package. That
order is the point — once the archive exists, every fix means building it again,
and once it is listed the bytes are with buyers.

It is advisory. It is not the marketplace's safety scan, it does not predict
that scan's verdict, and passing here is not approval — it is one careful look
before you spend a fee and hand your bytes to buyers, who receive them exactly
as you upload them.

Two severities:

  STOP  Something that does not belong in a listing at all: a compiled program,
        an archive nested inside your source, or a vendored dependency tree.
  LOOK  Something worth a human decision. For each one you are deciding between
        three things: it is a fair part of what you are selling, it is a leak
        you want to remove, or it is something that should not be published.
        Only you can tell those apart.
